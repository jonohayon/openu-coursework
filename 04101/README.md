> My solutions to ashnav's assignments (mamans) and quizzes (mamachs) from the 2017a fall semester

_Note - these assignments are written in English because back in the day I didn't know how to use Hebrew in LaTeX. All of the other courses' assignments are written in Hebrew._

## But what is ashnav?
The word ashnav means a window in hebrew. Ashnav is essentially the math 101 course in the open university of Israel and is required to be taken by anyone in highschool who wants to study there.
Ashnav covers a little bit of material about sets, groups, operations, functions, axioms, symmetry groups, euclidic geometry and mathematical induction. Basic stuff.
